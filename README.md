Legacies & Legends
==================

...is a Superhero MUSH using the Ares codebase with a few tweaks of our own. This will (eventually) be the repository we use to udpate the server and will (eventually) have some customizations to the look, feel and functionality to better suit a freeform, systemless storytelling style game. I've already made a few changes directly on our server and the next step is to put them in here before working on extra changes. However I have just spent far too long fighting with Docker to get a locally hosted ARES setup and now I need to lie down for a few years.

AresMUSH
========

Virtual reality and 3D games may be the next big thing, but for almost thirty years, players have been creating their own online worlds using nothing but words and their imaginations on MUSHes. A MUSH is a multi-player online game that blends creative writing, improv acting, and role-playing into a unique interactive storytelling experience. 

AresMUSH is a next-gen server platform that brings modern features to MUSH games: a fully-featured web portal and wiki, automated scene logging, web-based character creation, and more. With AresMUSH, you can launch your own MUSH game with no coding experience.
